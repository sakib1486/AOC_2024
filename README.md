# AOC_2024

This repository contains day by day update for [AOC(Advent of Coding)] (https://adventofcode.com/) for the year of 2024.

To run, clone the repository with:

`git clone  https://github.com/sakib1486/AOC_2024.git`

Then, on the terminal you can browse through each of the directories which are structured as follows:

```
- DayX
-- input.txt
-- main.py
-- part1.py
-- part2.py
......
```

In each directory, if you run the following:

`python main.py`

It should show the output results for the input data given to me. Please note that the input is randomized for everybody, but the code should work the same way as the problem is identical for the participants.
